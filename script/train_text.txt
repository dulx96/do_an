The tables crammed way close , menu typical Italian restaurant , wine list simply overpriced .
Slightly average wines start $ 70+ one selection listed $ 30+ .
Service one would expect joint price category .
For instance , plates dumped table , I handed wine list upside , etc ... .
Somehow working italian charm constant mille grazie constitute proper service .
To completely fair , redeeming factor food , average , could n't make deficiencies Teodora .
To celebrate birthday , three us went Mare anticipating great food .
Not one meals edible - bland and/or made weird rosemary orange flavoring .

waitstaffs nice though .

For lazy folks n't want come Alphabet City , I say , good - stay .
less wait time !
We arrived time reservation seated promptly .
The menu many fish items oysters .

The fish really , really fresh .
I lived Maine ten years grew fish .

It 's die !
The food mediocre best horrible service made vow never go back .
Immediately paid , waiter took money said , okay , guys outta .
There people waiting !
We n't even table hour total .
As leaving , couple standing door said another waiter , 're hurry .
Our friends arrived yet .
So rushing us absolutely unnecessary !
For people want great food plus great service , Roxy place AVOID !
I 've twice .
The first time sushi outstanding , second time little bland .
I 'm sure I 'll return final judgement tho .
The blond wood decor soothing , premium sake excellent service great .
Mizu Japenese find Grammercy .

My friend devoured chicken mashed potatos .
Delicious crab cakes .
Even food n't good , garden great place sit outside relax .
Great neighborhood joint .
This nice pizza place good selection thin crust pizza including Basil slice .
Their calzones horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK .
They smell like stuff old canned vegetables like spinach mushroom calzone .
The counter service bad .
They charge different prices time .
They 're rude times , friendly .
NO PIZZA 33 !
Anybody likes place must different planet , greasy , dry tasteless complimentary .
The dosas skimpy , unattractive drip grease , personally I 'd drink popcorn topping I 'd eat another one .
The sandwiches dry , tasteless way overpriced .
Calling place Hampton Chutney Co. warn folks offer style substance , unattractive room unhelpful clerks dearth former .
Seriously , place kicks ass .
The atmosphere unheralded , service impecible , food magnificant .
Best Italian food I ever ( Italian , means alot ) .
It nearly impossible get table , ever chance go dinner , DO NOT pass .
This lovely , peaceful place eat outside .
The restaurant looks beautiful green lawns Hudson River Statue Liberty .
It set far small street 's , traffic noise .
The food good , especially basic dishes , drinks delicious .
This great place take out-of-towners , perfect watching sunset .
Great sushi experience .
Nice value .
Unique apppetizers .
Try sushimi cucumber roll .
Good spreads , great beverage selections bagels really tasty .
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
I complete total bagel experience lightly toasted .
Murray wo n't .
Wo n't Ca n't service directory .
But says Murray 's anything service .
So close , good enough .
Do n't fooled crowds people .
The service awful .
This place worth prices .
Also , n't plan asking favorite roll , 's menu , ca n't .
Love Pizza 33..
I friends sudden I hungry I crave one thing ... Pizza .
I live neightborhood regular .
It hits spot every time
This tiny Williamsburg spot always pleasantly surprising .
The pizza delicious proprietor one nicest NYC .
Even pasta delicious ( rarity New York pizza restaurants ) .
I 've many time never disappointed .
Compared Ess-a , Tal offers less doughy bagel !
They even scoop nice ( diet ) much little .
The cream cheeses world I love coffee ! !
A little crowded move line really fast !
A little pricey really hits spot Sunday morning !
Bagels ok , sure make special requests !
I asked open faced cheese sandwich manager basically told take business elsewhere !
Be sure get anything bagels ! ..
turkey burgers scary !
The worst excuse Japanese food I 've ever encountered .
The soup udon soy sauce water .
The sushi awful !
The rice poor quality cooked badly hard .
Furthermore , rice seasoning , sushi bland disgusting .
The fish adequate , inexpertly sliced .
It obvious one restaurant idea experience Japanese cuisine .
Good , fast service .
I would highly recommend .
Food great inexpensive .
The location perfect .
Give try enjoy .
I thought going Jimmys would give real Domincan exprience .
Jimmy Dominican !
Well , place Ghetto even funny .
If like music blasted system isnt great want pay least 100 dollar bottle minimun 'll love .
Would NEVER go back .
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .
That place awesome , , , sally !
Awsome Pizza especially Margheritta slice .
Always busy fast moving .
Great atmoshere worth every bit .
Open late ( well late I ever got I 'm night person )
Winnie staff best crew find serving .
The food reliable price moderate .
What ask ?
For authentic Thai food , look Toons .
Ive many Thai restaurants Manhattan , Toons far best Thai food Ive ( except mom 's course ) .
Try Pad Thai , sample anything appetizer menu ... 're delicious .
Everything restaurant special .
The service attentive , yet discreet .
The flavors robust subtle .
The brioche lollies party favors cute sweet touch memorable meal .
I 'm saving next visit .
I went late afternoon bite size food refleshment date .
The place quiet delightful .
Service good food wonderful .
I try caviar I tried salmon crab salad ( good )
It definitely good spot snacks chat .
As retired hipster , I say degree certainty last year Lucky Strike best laid-back late night city .
The wait staff pleasant , fun , part gorgeous ( wonderful aesthetic beautification way , she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) .
The food yummy , especially cooked-to-perfection mussels spicy tomato sauce shoestring crispy fries .
But best part LS late night atmosphere , delightfully free BTs .
You get completely delish martini glass ( 's 2 1/2 drinks ) $ 8.50 ( I recommend Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) great homey setting great music .
The in-house lady DJ Saturday nights outrageously good taste music , moreover , takes requests .
You ca n't go wrong place .
Suan great place I often take friends ( classmates ) .
Its location good fact Hutner College near prices reasonable , makes students go back Suan .
I LOVE Thai
noodles shrimp chicken coconut juice MUST !
I love Pongsri 48th , compared Suan slow service overpriced .
I go back Suan soon !
In summer-eat outside terrace ( another great feature Suan ) ! ! !
I imagine friendlier staff working restaurant .
I imagine better Indian food city .
I imagine rushing eat .
This restaurant used regular Thursday night dinner location .
During course past 3 months , chef staff changed better .
I wish would change back .
The food inconsistent .
This kind place 'd like take friends still keep secret .
The setting casual romantic .
Prices good .
The food excellent !
're daring , try balsamic vinegar icecream , 's wonderful !
Do get Go Go Hamburgers , matter reviews say .
They rip-off ( $ 8.95 four small meat patties steamed buns ) worth trying .
The rest dim sum , though pricey Chinatown standards , worth .
Steamed fresh brought hot hot hot table .
The wait long dim sum , n't like sharing tables typical raucous dim sum atmosphere gig , sleek ( Chinatown ) alternative .
A tips : skip turnip cake , roast pork buns egg custards .
These overpriced get better around corner :
( 1 ) turnip cakes little kiosk east side Mott St. south bayard
( 2 ) egg custards pork buns either bakery west side Mott street south Canal .
After passing restaurant sometime I finally decided go dinner .
I pleasantly suprised .
The food exceptional .
The menu consisted standard brassiere food , better places like Balthazar etc .
I choose go one special , braised lamb shank red wine , excellent .
The service friendly atmosphere casual .
The restaurant bit noisy something overlooked sit enjoy great meal
little place cute interior decor affordable city prices .
pad se ew chicken delicious , however pad thai far oily .
would ask oil next time .
Have eaten Ginger House several times , 's always good .
The fried dumplings GREAT !
Finally reliable Chinese restaurant !
This place would much better served run group actually understands customer service .
The thing walk eat .. planning event , especially small , intimate one , forget .
They helpful least give grand run around time event date rolls around regret chosing place , also become hostile !
Nobody restaurant give firm answers anything end , one person takes responsibility anything .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves shut-down .
Never fails please .
delicious bagels , especially right oven .
Spreads toppings great - though bit pricey .
Service fast friendly .
Only drawback - wo n't toast bagel , n't make eggs bagel .
But highly forgivable .
Been , done , New York , 's big deal .
The food decent best , ambience , well , 's matter opinion , may consider sweet thing , I thought annoying .
If celebrities make sweat , ride , like around parts 'll yawn wonder whats hype .
Rao good restaurant , 's nothing special .
I 've eaten many different Indian restaurants .
But last night , Spice Grill place I 'm eating indian cuisine .
You must try shrimp appetizers .

I love Ess-a-bagel , I live west side , I often go Murray 's convenience .
Their bagels fine , little overcooked , really 'special ' bagel experience .
Better bagel shop corner , worth going way , opinion .
Also little expensive average bagel place .
Great bagels made old-fashioned way .
The appetizing excellent - good Zabars Barney Greengrass reasonable price ( bought pound ) .
Drawbacks : service slow n't toast !
The food absolutely amazing ! !
The baked clams octopus shared appetizers best 've ever ! !
The lamb tender full flavor , dessert divine ! !
The waiter attentive .
The place beautiful bar scene seems happening .
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers ok , waiter gave poor suggestion..try potato stuff kanish best one .
Small servings main entree , salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend chicken , good .
Dessert joke ... dont bother
Volare virgins weekly regulars , everyone gets treated ca n't ask service friendly .
The restaurant Family feel , least regard portions enormous ; veal alone could single-handedly solved third world famine .
The anti-pasta excellent , especially calamari , filling pasta mains .
The wine list extensive easily hike otherwise reasonably priced meal .
Still , quibbles bill off-set pour-your-own measures liquers courtesey house ...
Fantastic place .
Cute decorative .
A pleasant surprise .
Go relax feel like somewhere else .
Lucky Strike great casual place grab bite eat .
Yeah crowd take bit seriously , n't .

This place , months old , perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !
Fabulous decor - makes feel like 're trendy Manhattan restaurant , good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , 're Manhattanite , spend time Manhattan , Rice Avenue make feel home ... ..very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus expensive prices pretentious clientele ... ..all Roosevelt Avenue !
We seated outside waiter spilled red wine hot tea date .
We shooed inside .
One would think 'd get apology complimentary drinks - instead , got snobby waiter would n't even take order 15 minutes gave us lip asked .
We left , never return .
With many good restaurants UWS , I n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff n't recognize work glorified diner , clumsy service , management n't care .
I relatively new area tried Pick bgel 2nd disappointed service I thought food overated pricey side .
If area try The Bagel Shoppe 74th street 3 blocks away 2nd Ave .
Great bagels , spreads good place hang .
You fellas says best Taiwanese restaurant town .
However ONLY Taiwanese restaurant town .
The food okay prices mediocre .
You ca n't say cheap food cheaper Chinatown .
They 're better Taiwanese restaurants located Flushing , Queens .
Baluchi 's solid food nice decor reasonable prices .
The problem manager complete incompetent .
He offers subpar service personality .
In fact , appears going go postal moment .
Skip location go one Soho .

WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
Very immature bartender , didnt know make specific drinks , service slowwwww , food fresh warm , waitresses busy flirting men bar werent attentive customers .
I would never recommend place anybody even casual dinner .
awesome
food always fresh ...
overpriced japanese food mediocre service
Went sat 1/26 disappointed .
Chicken teriyaki tomato pimentos top ? ?
food luke warm .
The waitress attentive .
I looking banana tempura dessert dont .
Too many good places settle .
Not `` The Four Seasons '' ... – allowed charge arm leg romatic dinner .
The food excellent well service , however , I left The Four Seasons dissappointed .
I think dinner Manhattan cost $ 400.00 I swept feet .
Red Dragon Roll - favorite thing eat , food group - hands
Just go Yamato order Red Dragon Roll .
If n't like , I n't know tell .
The Seafood Dynamite also otherworldly .
I 'm even going bother describe ; speaks .
Favorite Sushi NYC
I eaten 'best ' sushi joints NYC ( Nobu , Bond Street , JewelBako , etc ) Yamato favorite .
An unpretentious spot Park Slope , sushi consistently good , service pleasant , effective unassuming .
In summer months , back garden area really nice .
The rolls creative I yet find another sushi place serves inventive yet delicious japanese food .
The Dancing , White River Millenium rolls musts .
SO GOOD
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... )
Gross food – Wow-
I ca n't remember last time I gross food New York .
My quesadilla tasted like made three-year old sense proportion flavor .
And $ 11 plate bland guacamole ?
Come .
Do n't get started margaritas , either .
Mine tasted like bartender forgotten add tequila .
Really , I find rather scandalous crappy restaurant attracts crowds -- , city million restaurants , least 9/10 way better one .
Save money time go somewhere else .
Oh , I never write reviews -- I moved bad place , I felt duty spread word .

Best Indian Restaurant City
Decor needs upgraded food amazing !
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes many consider best gyros New York .
Small , bright , clean , BZ Grill stands apart usual run gyro joints , Astoria .
What really makes shine food , aggressively seasoned Cyrpriot spices , made in-house ( even gyro meat sausages ) , made much higher quality ingredients might otherwise expected .
All various Greek Cypriot dishes excellent , gyro reason come -- n't eat one trip wasted .
Best restaurant Brooklyn
The best !
Great food , amazing service , place class act .

Fresh , mind blowing flavors .
This place must visit !

Got date ? Go !
Every time I special occasion boyfriend I hard time going anywhere else .

Most booths allow sit next eachother without looking like 'that ' couple .
The food shared get order together eat together .
I 've enjoyed 99 % dishes 've ordered exceptions occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm daring eater THAT daring ) .
Once try special occasion beware.. ca n't stop !
You 'll ther every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ...

We thought dessert would better , Wrong !

The floor wet , trash filled hand towels n floor , soap , hand towels left .
Go son cubano edgewater nj instead .
Good Experience
During trip NYC , made reservations dine pool room Four Seasons pre-theater menu ( offering modified menu $ 65 pp ) .
The wine list extensive - though staff seem knowledgeable wine pairings .
The bread received horrible - rock hard cold - `` free '' appetizer olives disappointing .
However , main course wonderful .
I fish husband filet - exceeded expectations .
The dessert ( pear torte ) good - , , staff unable provide appropriate drink suggestions .
When inquired ports - waitress listed several know taste variations cost .
Not I would expect price prestige location .
All , I would return - beautiful restaurant - I hope staff pays attention little details future .
short sweet – seating great : 's romantic , cozy private .
The boths small reviews make look 're perfect 2 people .
The service extremely fast attentive ( thanks service button table ) I barely understood 1 word waiter took order .
The food ok fair nothing go crazy .
.
Over looks place exceeds actual meals .
So really end paying restaurant food .
Will prob . return great dinning experience try atleast .
Impressed ...
Subtle food service
Noodle pudding exactly type service food I enjoy .
Servers different , Greg favorite .
Sometimes tables n't understand sense humor 's refreshing server personality , professionalism , respects privacy dinner .
This first place I 've runner remembers order ... hope likes job I half mind steal restaurant .
Prices fair across board food bev .
I go eat like courses , servers patient never rush courses force another drink .

BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !
Stepping Casa La Femme last night true experience unlike New York !
Highly impressed decor food hospitality great night I !
The great cocktail Citrus Vodka lemon lime juice mint leaves die !
Food took time prepare , worth waiting .
We drawn belly dancing show captivated crowd .
I never write sites restaurant def worth commending !
Great find West Village !
Maggot food !
I 've wanting go place forever finally got table .
The menu looked great , waiter nice , food came , average .
Nevertheless , I finished plate , 's I found maggot mushroom sauce bottom .
I showed manager , smilingly apologized brought us two free desserts ( ask us wanted brought last two desserts would asked ) .
When bill came , nothing comped , I told manager politely willing pay wine , I n't think I pay food maggot .
Yes , I ate food , I certainly would I seen maggot eating , I point fairly sick stomach .
The manager finally said would comp two glasses wine ( cost less food ) , made seem like big concession .
We paid left n't feel like arguing .
I worked restaurants cook lot , way maggot able get well prepared food .
For restaurant good reputation usually packed , reason lack intelligent customer service .
A fairly late entry haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm n't league Blue Hills even Farm Adderlys world , 's pretty good , albeit somewhat dismal setting .
Unhygienic
I recommend .
I went 2times .
I got hair food 2 times !
Great place , great value .
The food flavorful , plentiful reasonably priced .
The atmosphere relaxed casual .
It 's great place order sit-in .
Awesome
Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !
Sushi experience unbelievable fiance .
Try !
Very pleased
Good creative rolls !
Yamato excellent place go youre sashimi , friends doesnt like sushi much .
They great rolls , triple color norwegetan rolls , awesome filling .
One special roll one regular roll enough fill , save room dessert !
They delicious banana chocolate dessert , well great green tea tempura .
The appetizers also delicious !
Amazing food .
Mazing interior .
Great food !
I 've fair share modern Japanese spot delivers .
The atmosphere pretty nice bit lacking , tries make crazy scheme mirrors .
If 're lost 're five feet table hey , 's good thing .
Despite confusing mirrors likely go-to modern Japanese food foreseeable future .
Another review claimed pre-fix $ 29/per person including sake $ 55 per person including sake .
Indo Chinese food , pretty good ...
Not fancy place good Chinese style Indian food .
The chicken lollipop favorite , dishes ( I agree previous reviewer ) quite oily spicy , espeically Chilli Chicken .
My mom originally introduced place , even ( Indian ) feels food somewhat top spicy far oily .
Still keep going back : )
I speechless horrible food .
I attended holiday dinner restaurant , food majorly disappointing .
Rather eating meat entree offered , I requested vegetarian dish .
Rather preparing vegetarian dish , chef presented plate steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , form aesthetic presentation ) .
I stunned , I left dinner hungry majorly disappointing .
This place survives reputation alone .
I NEVER return .
Best In ALL NYC

One best , THE best , restaurants Park Slope ( NY general )
Everything menu great .
This establishment real deal .
Wish NY kind places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch way around , certainly worth wait .
There `` Expensive-but-worth-it '' `` Expensive-and-WTF '' ?
This twenty-something guy n't mind laying $ 300 fine delicious meal 2 special occassions .

Vanison good amazing .
Bison quite excellent however .

Just good .
Some Pineapple covered glaze kind pear tart thing Not impressive .
I read reviews called restaurant expensive I thought , may worth .
I wrong .
The Four Seasons history sort landmark New York City restaurants , trust , charge nose say `` I 've four seasons restaurant '' .
I wanted go see worth sadly , curiousity got best I paid dearly .
All , food great ( except dessserts ) .
The environment upscale see lot rich guys trophy wives highly paid escorts .
If going food , worth .
Yes , good , I 've better cheaper .
You would think would make service , sadly , .
Service ok , 'd expect $ 500 .
Terrible Waste money.. scammers
I agree dining Casa La Femme like dining experience !
BUT good way .
I actually offended spent much money bad experience .
I literally got back home visiting Casa La Femme offended visit felt necessary try warn diners value money time .
We went celebrate two birthdays wanted something special different .
Our visit say least , unpleasant costly experience !
And even unpleasant costly unpleasant experience .
We arrive late reservation I complain much wait table .
Although told 10-15 minutes like 45 minutes .
We ushered bar wait momentarily upon arrival excited .
The place beautiful !
The hostess pleasant .
However , $ 14 drinks horrible !
Once finally got table , despite indicating wanted alla carte menu pushed table price fixed !
Since already waiting long , felt choice accept .
Our experience ever get better .
For course waited 1/2 hour 45 minutes never offered drink .
We also asked Hooka six times waiter kept telling us one minute never returning Hooka .
After 4th time asked waiter said dinner .
We asked beverages never received .
We asked sides waiter admitted forgot put part order .
My chicken inedible many fatty lumps keep spitting napkin .
I would expect $ 55 dinner .
By time finished dinner still received one beverage NOR hooka !
What waste 3 hours trapped table waiting waiting food drinks hooka.. never received !
The beverage receive water dirty glasses !
To top off.. main reason came restaurant belly dancers missed first show seated yet 2nd belly dancer danced two tables back restaurant never made around half restaurant .
By time left wallets empy stomachs AND missed show supposed see following dinner , would acceptable got enjoy experience good food belly dancers !
If seemed possible I would fought bill since dinner portion meal inedible !
I never left restaurant feeling abused , wasted hard earned money .
MY husbands birthday sons intended ... drove two hours spend much money treated terribly !
I wish I COULD refunded !
Do n't go larger group 4 !
I went family birthday dinner .
Five us walked approximately 6:20 Thursday evening .
The hostess said `` Wow 's large group , unless n't together '' , I replied `` , one , table six please . ''
At first little taken aback , seemed present problem , although restaurant looked fairly empty , hastily put table together us .
The menu fairly simple without much descriptions .
There tap beer evening , disappointment .
Not much selection bottled beer either , went Brahma .
The appetizers ordered served quickly - order fried oysters clams delicious tiny portion ( maybe 3 ) .
The lobster knuckles ( special day ) ok , pretty tasteless .
I believe 2 shrimp `` salt encrusted shrimp '' appetizer .
After ate appetizers ( took 8 minutes ) ordered another round Brahma 's - tried stall little waited sixth dinner member .
The waitress appeared asked us wanted go ahead order .
We replied would like wait 5 minutes okay .
She replied `` well would convenient us ordered , since larger party , might get crowded . ''
We called person close , told us order , .
The food arrived 15 minutes .
I Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... good .
Everyone seemed generally happy food , except brother grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched Grapfruit Juice !
I heard lobster roll excellent .
They seemed continue rush us along , taking plates without asking done ( sister still fork hand ) .
All food good - little expensive side , fresh .
Service friendliest `` large party '' !
Probably would go back .
Great Indian food
I lived 50th st , wanted Indian one day decided check place .
Food amazing - I love Indian food eat quite regularly , I say one best I 've .
Very `` normal Indian food '' , done really well .
I 4 instead 5 price ( chicken tikka masala - bread rice - $ 25 ) , I would expect upscale Indian restaurant place n't upscale feel .
Also , waiters try push food , like suggest things complimentary actually cost $ .
I n't appreciate places people try drive bill without patron 's knowledge huge turnoff ( price ) .
But 're prepared spend $ remember ask something offer complimentary , place go Indian food
One BEST
Bukhara Grill , tagline says all.. `` INDIAN SPICE RAVE ''
My GF I dine Bukhara often lives near .
The lunch buffet expensive deff worth .
We go often lunch place packed .
We gone dinner times great quality service given .
Bukhara top 5 Indian places NYC
Wretched retching
This third online review I ever made restaurant life .
They tonight restaurant .
I never disgusted food service .
For starters delivered us someone else 's order .
Fine , I wont hang .
However , I received predictably mediocre order Dokebi thinks passes Korean fair , ( sometimes settle 's option ) , I got half kimchee I found piece random lettuce accompanied far disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece fish skin .
Not one jump complaints ( hence lack previous online reviewing ) , I called restaurant give heads kitchen might want check cleanliness prep stations .
My main concern sanity food sent others , I would lying I said someone worked restaurants since age fifteen I expecting least minimal effort part restaurant amend situation .
None made hung .
Less three minutes passed I found doubled toilet .
My girlfriend , slightly aggressive , equally disgusted causing throw remainder barely eaten meal , called back informed I probably wrong likely oyster , also blacklisted restaurant .
Not I worked restaurants many years , I culinary school , I huge lover oysters fish , girlfriend half Korean !
We know difference oyster bad fish .
It n't restaurant major bragging points hand , 's simply repulsive .
Eat risk .
Gorgeous place ideal romantic dinner
I took boyfriend dinner saturday night .
I book gorgeous white organza tent included four course prix fix menu enjoyed lot .
The service spectacular waiter knew everything menu recommendations amazing !
I completely recommend Casa La Femme special occasion REALLY impress date .
More Williamsburg Garbage
My wife I visited Dokebi tonight .
We ordered dosut bibimbap nakgi-bokum .
The dishes came around 5 minutes apart .
The bibimbap average , stone bowl n't even close sizzling .
Too bad I paid extra $ 2 stone bowl .
The nakgi-bokum horrible .
Easily worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .
The sauce tasted like Chinese fast food decent Korean .
The side dishes passable , I get refill upon request .
The real problem I place complete lack service .
I mentioned squid dish n't good waitress visited .
She nodded walked .
There communications issues either , spoke perfect English .
As comment food , apology acknowledgment made .
My wife barely touched mess dish .
We charged full price .
If ware looking Korean fusion , I suggest try places East Village .
Authentic Korean food lovers visit 32nd Street , course .
Lives hype
We 've lived around corner place year finally dinner .
We 've tried always packed n't take reservations .
It well worth wait .
The wife risotto amazing .
It n't look appetizing 's covered squid ink turns lips teeth black , taste phenomenal .
The farro salad mashed yukon potatoes also extremely tasty .
love margherita pizza – looove east village pizza
Love place , every time city one places always go .
A quintessential slice NYC pizza .
The crust great bite good chew , sauce light nice acidity , salt cheese great , really heightens flavor components .
Personally I like margherita pizza better , good .
Possibly Most Romantic Restaurant City
This undoubtedly favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( ’ serve sushi ) , opinion , one romantic restaurants city !
Not adventure getting somewhat hidden spot , enter unmarked wooden doors , zen intimate décor make feel like ’ longer city .
If ’ planning come , make sure date someone really like since ’ ushered private booths people food watching ( choose ones ground level glass ceilings may see stars sky ! ) .
It ’ date occasional cute ‘ excuse ’ waiter opens little curtain booth !
My party BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , wonderful deal since also came flight sake !
I never used fan sakes lately experimenting lot acquiring better taste .
We started delightful sashimi amuse bouche .
Our first course Tuna Sashimi Green Yuzu Sauce .
I picked Grilled Black Cod entree , I absolutely devoured someone commented Grilled Salmon dish better .
The entrees served miso soup rice .
The sake ’ complimented courses well successfully easing sake world .
For desserts , tried frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting extraordinary ) matcha ( powdered green tea ) blueberry cheesecake , phenomenal .
Maybe great company ( I friends visiting Philly – yes , date time ) super reasonable price point , I ’ say enough good things brasserie .
I ’ usually visit establishment , twice , I ’ come Zenkichi anytime quiet , unhurried memorable dinner .
Terrible would compliment !
The service leaves much desired , feeling like rushed place order , ignored rest night .
We 10 people celebrtating birthday , sat tent .
We paid fixed pricce got nothing ! !
We never ate close 2 monring served upset ad tired start eating .
They extremely rude , even apologizing horrible service got handing us bill well $ 500 drinks adn pita bread !
Stay away
Great Shabu Shabu
I go least every week , particularly 's cold !
I love .
To honest ever eat Shabu Shabu .
I tried couple dishes n't impressed .
But Shabu Shabu , wo n't find much better NY .
In fact one I 've tried even compares ( shabu Tatsu ) even I prefer Dokebi .
The meat fresh , sauces great , get kimchi salad free meal service good .
Dokebi gives Williamsburg right one-two punch classic Korean food fusion twists like pork belly tacos .
The hot dogs good , yes , reason get fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect supermarket squishy bun .
Restaurant view
Celebrated fathers birthday .
The food tasted good .
The family seafood entree good .
The main entree also good .
We order bit everything menu .
Price high food good , I would come back .
This place n't make sense
Just want warn - n't waste time money .
This place totally weird decor , stairs going mirrored walls - I surprised one yet broke head fall stairs - mirrored walls make dizzy delusional ...
This place inviting food totally weird .
The concept japanese tapas newly created clearly n't work .
The food serve comforting , appetizing uncooked .
Go japanese sushi place Spanish tapas place - creation Williamsburg misstake .
Good Food
I went boyfriend anniversary .
The food great tasty , sitting space small , I n't like cramp corner .
Over nice romantic place .
I would recommend ask bigger sitting area make reservation ( possible )
Loved
A coworker I tried Pacifico work Fridays loved .
The atmosphere great .
The food ordered excellent , although I would n't say margaritas anything write home .
Our waitress n't mean , especially warm attentive either .
I must say I surprised bad reviews restaurant earlier year , though .
Maybe improved since ?
Regardless , 'll back ca n't wait visit summer take advantage patio .
Dumbfoundingly Poor
This , start finish , mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .
Lexicographers take note : new fascinating definition rudeness alive flourishing right Brooklyn .
The servers Flatbush Farm appear perfected ghastly technique making feel guilty ashamed deigning attract attention .
Polite acknowledgement ;
supercilious scorn .
And many times pick perfectly aligned set napkins , inspect vapidly plonk exactly place instead venturing glance people help make rent ?
A different server enhanced fun , dumping entrees front us halfway appetizer ( delicious ) .
Overall food quality pretty good , though I hear salmon much better n't sat cooling front guest .
The place nice fit-out , attractive furnishings , I could tell , reasonable wine list ( I given food menu I asked carte des vins )
At $ 120 two people , however , way represents value , unless 're looking pay hour passive-aggressive torture .
On scale , 's world-beater .
How palce still open ?
I honestly n't even know begin .
My boyfriend I avid restaurant goers , always lookout new places friend recommended Flatbush Farms .
We arrived seated immediately , made us happy .
We ordered appetizers , I ordered chicken boyfriend salmon .
Everything going good got meals .
I took one look chicken I appalled .
It served skin , bed extremely undercooked spinach mashed potatoes .
My boyfriend asked I wanted switch eat salmon instead , de-skinned chicken I could enjoy white meat .
I took one bite $ 24 salmon , I never , 17 years I going restaurants tasted salmon fishy , dry , bland one Flatbush Farms .
At point , waitress comes asks us everything okay , I literally shocked I speechless n't say anything , guess , waitress WALKED away .
So , I switch boyfriend see maybe I could stomach meat spinach , spinach undercooked I could bite .
I could n't even enjoy mashed potatoes hidden completely chicken spinach .
I 've better chicken BBQs ! ! ! !
So I decide report back waitress completely inedible .
Guess , I waited TWENTY minutes came finally , says , `` oh well , I wish would said something earlier '' No apology , nothing .
After simply took plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later bill chicken ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
No desert menu , apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !
I literally going explode , instead , boyfriend took bill went find manager .
This really really gets bad : manager said , absolutely nothing , 's matter taste n't like , I comp .
Again , apology , anything else I get , I get drink make , nothing ! ! ! !
We refused pay point nothing food anymore .
The level rudeness preposterous .
The manager came table said want , paid enjoy , drinks appetizers , walked .
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .
cirspy crust margherita pizza
3 times since last week alked chance first day manager offerd us margherita pizza adn said yes .
really good pizza .
crust imazingly cooked well pizza fully loaded : ) : ) : )
know mean positives things happening made mw write review .
Single Worst Restaurant Manhattan
I 'll couple positives : cool decor , good pita hummus , grilled octopus actually pretty tasty .
Moving .
If I could give 0 stars I would place .
Casa La Femme middle eastern dining Chuckie Cheeze italian .
The reason 4 different results citysearch place keep trying start new thread stock positive reviews .
Well ... run ca n't hide .
I live West Village I 've lot restaurants .
Sometimes pay lot n't get much return - 's manhattan , things expensive .
However , least prompt pleasant .
This place ... god begin .
It quite spectacular scene 'll give .
The decor however seems distraction wo n't notice payed 300 bucks cold eggplant took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !
How place survives competitive west village market economy , matter , beyond .
Great Hot Dogs !
I 've made trip times friend lives nearby ( I live UWS ) .
Though 's crowded times I 've gone , Bark always delivers food .
The hot dogs top notch , 're Slamwich amazing !
Going Bark always worth train ride , make tongue belly happy !
Only complaint pricing -- I believe would reasonable pay dollar less item listed menu .
But nonetheless -- great spot , great food .
Fabulous food - front house staff n't put –
We live nearby BFC .
It 's little price range dining except special occasions , 've eaten 6 times last 2 years .
Each time 've , front house staff ( waiters - 're fantastic - people greet seat ) hideous us exceptional fish dishes I would never return .
As BFC n't take reservations almost always wait bar - abused front house staff seated , hour later !
The frizzy retro girl ( winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) yell try order drink .
I almost amused fact turning away customers 9pm Friday night `` BBQ go '' night - WTF ? ?
I 'd horrified staff turning away customers early rudely !
There 's another girl I ca n't describe , 5 ' 6 '' brown hair , eavesdrops conversation chimes - except hears last part said , uninvited opinions often context nothing 're *really* talking .
I 'm friendly person , I would n't mind nasty gotten personal .
Again , I 'd super upset employee .
Considering spend least $ 60 head , I expect better service .
So , 're walking thinking dining , might want see 's going seating first ...
Maitre-D- '' Eat get ''
My family ate last weekend .
The food service fine , however maitre-D incredibly unwelcoming arrogant .
While finishing meals included high-end bottle wine , son 's fiance joined us glass wine dessert .
This guy refused seat left , followed shortly four us , I told 40 years world travel , including Paris , I never seen display bad behavior frontman restaurant .
His response smug , arrogant , condescending , totally consistent deportment display evening .
A word wise : ca n't dine disturb maitre-D 's sense `` table turnover '' , whacked , else .
If go , off-night .
Best meal long time !
Mussles calamari superb Saturday evening .
I Lamb special perfect .
My father flank steak good , mother swordfish .
The Four Seasons restaurant great experience .
The food great environment even better .
Everyone must come least .
Highly recommend !
Taking Hot Dogs next level
At first glance place seems bit pricey hot dog joint , Bark n't get average hot dog .
Here hot dog elevated level real entree numerous variations available .
Great Atmosphere
Went place place real cold night needed quick meal .
I highly recommend fish tacos , everything else ok .
Cool atmosphere , fire place back really ads needs bit heat throughout cold night .
Poor service management
Don ’ go place !
Had awful experience Casa la Femme Saturday dinner .
Appetizers took nearly hour .
When main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half order missing .
Never got explanation going .
The manager rude handled situation extremely poorly .
When threatened leave , offered meager discount even though half order missing .
On way , heard guests complaining similar issues .
Can ’ believe expensive NYC restaurant disrespectful clients .
What hassle !
The food good , outstanding .
There way justifies accolades receives , attitude staff wait table .
On last visit , skipped name list , leaving us waiting extra hour table .
Mistakes happen , usually accompanied apology , perhaps even glass wine ... grunt received Al Di La staff .
Without wait attitude , I would probably go back , many restaurants Brooklyn good better n't make jump hoops .
Expensive
I went hearing great .
Wow .
The bread stale , salad overpriced empty .
The pasta well cooked , n't enough sauce though flavor .
I though expensive I prefer Bella Via blocks away far .
So rude ! ! !
I went JWILS .
Her review .
I one people went horrible experience .
My friend 100 % right experience .
The hostess rude I got distinct feeling want serve us .
The thing friend left sat bar bartender disappeared .
I asked menu waitress looked like I insane .
I shocked friends wanted stay waitress said , `` I help '' `` many party . ''
What ?
The three us standing front indication many us .
We n't look like patrons unfortunately I think may part problem .
Shame place horrible rude staff non-existent customer service .
bad staff
I generally like place .
The food good .
The design space good .
But service HORRID !
I brunch recently , tag teamed waitress waiter .
The waiter delivered food holding appeared plastic bag garbage one hand .
I ca n't believe , please put bag delivering food !
The waitress came check us every minutes , began clear plates half us still eating ( big pet peeve mine happens almost everywhere , I try ignore ) .
I could n't ignore fact reach plate one friends , mid bite , clear table .
She put check without asking done , came check bill every two minutes , even though one three occupied tables .
I wish I could like place , I wish someone would retrain staff .
